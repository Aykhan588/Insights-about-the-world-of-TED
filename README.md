# Insights-about-the-world-of-TED
I conducted an analysis of TED data obtained by running a custom web scraper on the official TED.com website to get insights about the world of TED, its speakers, and its viewers. Using the histogram, I investigated the summary statistics, and the distribution of the views garnered on various TED Talks. I built the scatterplot and the correlation matrix to see if the number of views is correlated with the number of comments. In order to see which talks tend to attract the largest amount of discussion, I defined a new feature discussion quotient which is simply the ratio of the number of comments to the number of views to check which talks have the most considerable discussion quotient. Using a bar chart, I analyzed the TED talks (especially TEDx) by month and year and the most popular days for conducting TED and TEDx conferences. I constructed a heat map that shows us the number of talks by month and year, which gave me a good summary of the distribution of talks.
